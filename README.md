Art Gallery Management System using PSQL and Python <br>

This project primarily deals with managing details of paintings, employees, customers 
and other stakeholders. We can maintain a record of the paintings present in the gallery, 
detailsof customers who buy these paintings. We can also enter new paintings available 
for sale. We can also record the details of the employees who work there.

<b> Front End for the execution of queries: </b> <br>
-	Python is used to implement the front end.
- It is easy to use and understand and given that we are familiar with the language, we decided to opt python.
- Python also supports an API to work on psql databases, psycopg2. The library is very convenient to use and has a wide variety of functions which makes it easier to work with.
- Psycopg2 is a PostgreSQL adapter for the Python programming language. It is a wrapper for the libpq, the official PostgreSQL client library.  The quickest way to install Psycopg is using the wheel package available on PyPI. ‘pip install pyscopg2’ is also one of the ways to install the package.
